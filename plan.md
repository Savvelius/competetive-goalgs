1. Dynamic programming
2. Divide and Conquer
3. Greedy - identify a function that should be minimized with each iteration

* hashmap - results for some values repeat (cashing)
* Prefix sums - find sum of subarray. Summing can be generalized to any reversible operation (xor, ...)
* Prefix polynomial hash sums - contains subarray?
* Two pointer - some contiguous parts of array are continuously re-evaluated
* prefix function/analogues (dynamic programming subcase)
* heap - need dynamic access to min/max elements
* Manachen algorithm - any palindrome problems
